          "context": "Introduction to Computer Network\nIntroduction:\n A network is a set of devices (nodes) connected by a communication link.\n A node can be a computer, printer or any devices capable of sending or\nreceiving data generated by other nodes on the network.\n Computer network is a large number of separate computers that are\ninterconnected to exchange data and information.\n In computer network, users directly interact with the actual machine to\ninvoke the data exchange and the system do not attempt to make the\ncomputers or machines to act coherently.\nUses of Computer Network:\n1. Marketing and sales\nUsed to collect, exchange and analyze data relating to costumers needs\nand product development cycles. Eg. Teleshopping, online services, ecommerce etc.\n2. Financial Services\nFinancial services like electronic fund transfer, foreign currency\nexchange etc.\n3. Manufacturing\nMultiple users/ workers can work on a project simultaneously which\nleads faster production of materials.\n4. Electronic Messaging\nEmail, Messenger, Hangout etc\n5. Tele-Conferencing\nVideo call, audio call etc. this could be helpful in distant learning and\ntelemedicine.\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f6. Resource Sharing\nIt allows all programs, equipment and data available to anyone on the\nnetwork irrespective of the physical location of the resources and the\nuser.\n7. Availability of Data\nIt provides high reliability by having alternative sources of data, so that\nthe data is always available. Mechanism such as replication of data and\nbackup are used.\n\nNetworking Models:\nClient/Server Model:\n- Data are stored in powerful computers known as server.\n- Server is managed by a system administrator.\n- Users have simple computers called clients.\n- Client and server computers are connected by a network.\n- Communication occurs as follows:1. Client sends request to server over the network.\n2. Client waits for a reply.\n3. Server gets the request, performs the requested tasks and sends back a\nreply.\n- It is a centralized communication model.\n- A single server can have multiple clients associated to it.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fTwo types of clients:\n1. Thin Client: It is network computer with no local storage. It processes\ninformation independently but relies on servers for applications, storage\nand administration. For eg. Web browser\n2. Thick Client: More powerful computers capable of handling independent\napplications. They have their own local storage. E.g. gaming apps, video\nediting apps.\n\nFig: Client-Server Model\nPeer-to-Peer Model:\nIn peer to peer model, computers simply connect with each other in a workgroup\nto share files, printers and internet access. Instead of internet information being\nheld in a few central locations, peer-to-peer computing makes it theoretically\npossible to access the files and data residing on every personal computer\nconnected to the internet.\nAll computers and users have equal authority and rights. A peer in P2P network\nacts as both a client and a server in traditional client/server architecture.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\ffig: peer-to-peer model\nThe main two application of this model are:\nDistributed Computing: these applications typically require the decomposition of\nlarger problem into smaller parallel problems (e.g. SETI@home)\nFile Sharing applications: require efficient search across wide area networks (e.g.\nNapster, Freenet, torrent)\n\nActive Networks:\nActive network is a type of network architecture that allows packets traveling\nthrough the network to dynamically modify the operation of network. That is, it is\na network in which the nodes are programmed to perform custom operations on\nthe messages that pass though the node. The packets in active network are called\nactive packets. These active packets have a small piece of code along with data.\nActive network consists of active hardware, capable of routing or switching as\nwell as executing code within active packets. The idea is to send code along with\npackets of information allowing the data to change its form to match the channel\ncharacteristics.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fPROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS:\nIn Order to make communication successful between devices , some rules and\nprocedures should be agreed upon at the sending and receiving ends of the\nsystem. Such rules and procedures are called as Protocols . Different types of\nprotocols are used for different types of communication.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fStandards are the set of rules for data communication that are needed\nfor exchange of information among devices. It is important to follow Standards\nwhich are created by various Standard Organization like IEEE , ISO , ANSI etc.\n\nOSI Reference Model:\nThis model is based on a proposal developed by the International Standards\nOrganization (ISO). The model is called the ISO OSI (Open Systems\nInterconnection) Reference Model because it deals with connecting open\nsystems—that is, systems that are open for communication with other systems.\nThe OSI model has seven layers. The principles that were applied to arrive at the\nseven layers can be briefly summarized as follows:\n1. A layer should be created where a different abstraction is needed.\n2. Each layer should perform a well-defined function.\n3. The function of each layer should be chosen with an eye toward defining\ninternationally standardized protocols.\n4.The layer boundaries should be chosen to minimize the information flow across\nthe interfaces.\nThe Physical Layer:\nFunctions:\n To activate, maintain and deactivate the physical connection.\n To define voltages and data rates needed for transmission.\n To convert the digital bits into electrical signals.\nThe physical layer does not perform the detection and correction of errors.\nBelow the physical layer lies the transmission medium.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFIG: OSI REFERENCE MODEL\nData link layer:\n Framing: The data link layer divides the stream of bits received from the\nnetwork layer into manageable data units called frames.\n Physical addressing: Data link layer adds a header to the frames to define\nthe sender and receiver of the frame. i.e. it adds up MAC address.\n Flow control: if the rate at which the data are absorbed by the receiver is\nless than the rate at which data are produced in the sender or vice-versa,\nthe data link layer imposes a flow control mechanism to avoid\noverwhelming the receiver.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f Error control: it has mechanism to detect and retransmit damaged or lost\nframes.\n Access control: when two or more devices are connected to the same link,\ndata link layer protocols are necessary to determine which device has\ncontrol over the link at any given time.\nNetwork Layer:\n To route the signals through various channels to the other end.\n To act as network controller by deciding which route data should take.\n It works in logical address. i.e. IP addresses are added with the data\nsegment received from higher layer and form a packet.\n To divide the outgoing messages into packets and to assemble incoming\npackets into messages for the higher levels.\nTransport layer:\n It accepts data from above it, splits it up into smaller units called\nsegments and passes them to network layer.\n It ensures that the pieces all arrive correctly at the other end.\n It guarantees the transmission of data from one end to the another.\n It also provides the facility of broadcasting the messages to multiple\ndestinations.\nThe session layer:\n This layer manages and synchronizes the conversation between two\ndifferent applications. This is the level at which the user will establish\nsystem to system connection.\n It include dialog control i.e. keeping track of whose turn it is to transmit\ndata\n The session layer allows a process to add checkpoints or synchronization\npoints to a stream of data, so that it can pick up from where they left off in\nthe event of a crash and subsequent recovery.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fThe Presentation Layer:\n The presentation layer receives the data from the application layer. It\nmakes sure that the information is delivered in such a form that the\nreceiving system will understand and use it. i.e. it converts the data into\nmachine format( binary format).\n It also performs the compression and encryption of the data so that there is\nintegrity in data.\nApplication Layer:\nThe application layer contains a variety of protocols that are commonly\nneeded by the users. One widely used application protocol is HTTP (HyperText\nTransfer Protocol), which is the basis for the World Wide Web. When a browser\nwants a Web page, it sends the name of the page it wants to the server hosting\nthe page using HTTP. The server then sends the page back. Other application\nprotocols are used for file transfer, electronic mail, and network news.\n\nFig: Summary Of OSI Reference Model\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fTCP/IP Model:\nTCP/IP is a result of protocol research and development conducted on the\nexperimental packet-switched network, ARPANET, funded by the Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and is generally referred to as the\nTCP/IP protocol suite. This protocol suite consists of a large collection of protocols\nthat have been issued as Internet standards by the Internet Activities Board (IAB).\n\nFIG: TCP/IP Reference Model\n\nHost-to-network/Network Access Layer:\n It contains all the details in the OSI physical and data link layer.\n It deals with the issues that an ip packet requires to actually make the\nphysical link.\n It deals with the physical transmission of the data along with the signal\nencoding techniques, data rate, bandwidth and physical connector.\n Framing, synchronization, flow control and error control.\n Protocols such as Ethernet, Token Ring, Frame Relay etc are used\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fThe Internet Layer:\n It defines packet format called IP Packet and protocol called internet\nprotocol.\n It is concerned with packet addressing\no Send source packets from any network and have them arrive at the\ndestination independent of the path and networks they took to get\nthere.\no May arrive in different order to destination\no Job of higher layer to arrange them.\n Other protocols used by internet layer are ARP(Address Resolution\nProtocol), RARP(Reverse Address Resolution Protocol), ICMP(Internet\ncontrol message protocol) etc.\n Congestion control while routing.\n\nThe Transport Layer:\n The transport layer deals with the quality-of-service (QoS) issues of\nreliability, flow control, and error correction.\n Connection Oriented and Connectionless services\no Transmission control Protocol (TCP)\n Connection oriented\n Reliable\n Transmission of byte stream without any errors\no User datagram protocol (UDP)\n Connectionless\n Fast but unreliable\n May contain minute errors in byte stream.\n Connection Establishment, error control, flow control.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fThe Application Layer:\n Provides access to the TCP/IP environment for users and also provides\ndistributed information services.\n Handles higher layer protocols\no FTP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS\n\nComparison between OSI and TCP/IP\n OSI models centralizes in three concepts namely services, interfaces and\nprotocols. TCP/IP does not have clear distinction between these.\no Services tell what the layer does, not how the layer works\no Interface tells the process above it, how to access it\no Protocols: can use any protocol as long as the job is done\n OSI model is a generic model that is based upon functionalities of each\nlayer. TCP/IP model is a protocol-oriented standard.\n In OSI, the model was developed first and then the protocols in each layer\nwere developed. In the TCP/IP suite, the protocols were developed first and\nthen the model was developed.\n The OSI has seven layers while the TCP/IP has four layers.\n The OSI model supports both connection oriented and connectionless\ncommunication in the network layer but only connection oriented\ncommunication in transport layer. The TCP/IP model has only\nconnectionless mode in the network layer but supports both modes in the\ntransport layer.\n The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to\nthe network access layer of the TCP/IP model. The network layer of OSI\ncorresponds to the internet layer while transport layer on the both are\nsame. The session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer of\nthe OSI model together form the application layer of the TCP/IP Model.\n\nBy: Er.

It specifies a protocol called x.21.\no Frame layer: it is responsible for reliable transfer of data across the physical layer\nby transmitting it as a sequence of frames. It adds header and trailer to the\npacket.\no Packet layer: it facilitates end-to-end connection between two DTEs. The data is\nintegrated with a header to form a packet. It is also responsible for creating\nvirtual circuits.\n X.25 network devices fall into 3 categories:\no Data terminal equipment (DTE)\n Terminals, personal computers and network hosts\no Data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE) and\n Modems\no Packet switching exchange (PSE)\n Switches that make up the carrier network\n\nFig: X.25 Operation\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFrame Relay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs like X.25, frame relay is also based on packet-switched technology. However differs\nsignificantly in its functionality and format.\nFrame relay is a high-performance WAN protocol that operates at the physical and data\nlink layers of the OSI reference model.\nFrame Relay has the variable data rate while the X.25 has the fixed data rate.\nFrame Relay sends information in packets called frames through a shared Frame Relay\nnetwork. Each frame contains all the information necessary to route it to the correct\ndestination.\nDevices attached to a Frame Relay WAN fall into two general categories:\no Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)\no Data Circuit-terminating equipment (DCE)\nExamples of DTE devices are mainly personal computers or Routers.\nDCEs are carrier-owned internetworking devices. The purpose of DCE equipment is to\nprovide clocking and switching services in a network, which are the devices that actually\ntransmit data through the WAN. In most cases, these are packet switches.\nFrame Relay provides connection-Oriented data link layer communication.\nThis service is implemented by using a frame relay virtual circuit, which is a logical\nconnection created between two data terminal equipment (DTE) devices across a frame\nrelay packet switched network.\nFrame Relay Virtual Circuits fall into two categories:\no Switched virtual circuits (SVCs)\no Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs)\nSwitched virtual circuits are temporary connections used in situation requiring data\ntransfer in irregular time interval between DTE devices across the frame relay network.\nPermanent virtual circuits are permanently established connections that are used for\nfrequent and consistent data transfer between DTE devices.\nA data link connection identifier (DLCI) is a Frame Relay 10-bit-wide link-local virtual\ncircuit identifier used to assign frames to a specific PVC or SVC.\n\nFig: Frame Relay Network\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fVOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol):\nIn essence, VoIP is the transmission of speech across IP-based network. VoIP works by encoding\nvoice information into a digital format, which can be carried across IP networks in discrete\npackets. VoIP has two main advantages over traditional telephony.\n\n\n\n\nA VoIP system is usually cheaper to operate than an equivalent telephone system with a\nPBX (Private Branch Exchange) and conventional telephone network service. There are\nseveral reasons for this. Whereas traditional telephone networks allocate dedicated\ncircuits for voice communications using circuit switching, VoIP uses packet switching,\nallowing the sharing of transmission capacity. Further, packetized voice transmission fits\nwell in the framework of the TCP/IP protocol suite, enabling the use of application- and\ntransport-level protocols to support communications.\nVoIP readily integrates with other services, such as combining Web access with\ntelephone features through a single PC or terminal.\n\nWith VoIP, the calling user (program or individual) supplies the phone number of a URI\n(Universal Resource Indicator, a form of URL), which then triggers a set of protocol\ninteractions resulting in the placement of the call. The heart of the call placement process\nfor VoIP is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), defined\nin RFC 3261, is an application level control protocol for setting up, modifying, and\nterminating real-time sessions between participants over an IP data network.\n\nVOIP Processing:\nOnce a called party responds, a logical connection is established between the two parties\n(or more for a conference call), and voice data may be exchanged in both directions. Figure\nbelow illustrates the basic flow of voice data in one direction in a VoIP system. On the\nsending side, the analog voice signal is first converted into a digital bit stream and then\nsegmented into packets. The packetization is performed, typically, by RTP (Real-time\nTransport Protocol ). This protocol includes mechanisms for labeling the packets so that\nthey can be reassembled in the proper order at the receiving end, plus a buffering function\nto smooth out reception and deliver the voice data in a continuous flow. The RTP packets\nare then transmitted across the Internet or a private internet using the User Datagram\nProtocol and IP protocols.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFig: VOIP Processing:\n\nEthernet:\nIEEE 802.3 standard and commonly known as Ethernet is a dominant scheme for wired local\narea network. The first commercially available Ethernet and the first version of IEEE 802.3 were\nbus-based systems operating at 10 Mbps. As technology has advanced, Ethernet has moved\nfrom bus-based to switch-based, and the data rate has periodically increased by an order of\nmagnitude. Currently, Ethernet systems are available at speeds up to 100 Gbps.\nTwo kinds of Ethernet exist: classic Ethernet, which solves the multiple access problem using\nthe techniques we have studied in this chapter; and switched Ethernet, in which devices called\nswitches are used to connect different computers. It is important to note that, while they are\nboth referred to as Ethernet, they are quite different. Classic Ethernet is the original form and\nran at rates from 3 to 10 Mbps. Switched Ethernet is what Ethernet has become and runs at\n100, 1000, and 10,000 Mbps, in forms called fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, and 10 gigabit\nEthernet. In practice, only switched Ethernet is used nowadays.\n\n\nFor classic Ethernet, as the frame of data needs to be sent through same medium,\nmedium access control (MAC) protocol such as CSMA/CD algorithm is used so that there\nis no collision between two data frames. In this method, the station senses the medium\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f\n\nwhen they have frame to send and send the frame as soon as the medium become idle.\nThey monitor the channel for collisions as they send. If there is a collision, they abort the\ntransmission with a short jam signal and retransmit after a random interval.\nSwitched Ethernet uses more advanced technology called switches. Switches consists of\nmultiple ports where each station can be connected with a standard RJ-45 connector.\nWhen the switch port receives an Ethernet frame from a station, the switch checks the\nEthernet addresses to see which port the frame is destined for and forwards the frame\nover its high-speed backplane to the destination port. Collisions are now impossible\nand CSMA/CD is not needed.\n\nFig: Classic Ethernet Connection\n\nFig: Switched Ethernet Connection\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fNGN (Next Generation Network):\nNGN a packet-based network able to provide telecommunication services and able to\nmake use of multiple broadband, QoS-enabled transport technologies and in which servicerelated functions are independent from underlying transport-related technologies. It offers\nunrestricted access by users to different service providers. It supports generalized mobility\nwhich will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of services to users. NGN has capabilities\nto support managed features of IP based network, especially QoS, Security and Mobility\nCharacteristics:\n Unified global networking platform\n Packet-based network\n Provides Telecommunication services to users\n Quality of service enabled transport technologies (Delay, Throughput, and\nreliability)\n Services are independent of transport technologies\n Unfettered access for users to network and services\n\nMulti-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS):\nMPLS is an efficient technique for forwarding and routing packets. MPLS was designed with IP\nnetworks in mind, but the technology can be used without IP to construct a network with any\nlink-level protocol, including ATM and frame relay. In an ordinary packet-switching network,\npacket switches must examine various fields within the packet header to determine\ndestination, route, quality of service, and any traffic management functions (such as discard or\ndelay) that may be supported. In an MPLS network, a fixedlength label encapsulates an IP\npacket or a data link frame. The MPLS label contains all the information needed by an MPLSenabled router to perform routing, delivery, QoS, and traffic management functions. Unlike IP,\nMPLS is connection oriented.\nThis is a layer 2.5 networking protocol that provides additional features for the transport of\ndata across the network. MPLS is a mechanisms is high- performance telecommunications\nnetworks that directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels\nrather than long network addresses, avoiding complex lookups in a routing table. MPLS\nsupports a range of access technologies, including T1/E1, ATM, Fame Relay and DSL.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fWorking:\nAn MPLS network or internet consists of a set of nodes, called label switching routers (LSRs),\ncapable of switching and routing packets on the basis of a label appended to each packet. For\neach distinct flow, called a forwarding equivalence class (FEC) a specific path through the\nnetwork of LSRs is defined, called a label switched path (LSP). In essence, an FEC represents a\ngroup of packets that share the same transport requirements. All packets in an FEC follow the\nsame path and receive the same QoS treatment at each hop. The LSRs need not examine or\nprocess the IP header but rather simply forward each packet based on its label value. Each LSR\nbuilds a table, called a label information base (LIB), to specify how a packet must be treated\nand forwarded. Thus, the forwarding process is simpler than with an IP router.\n\nFig: MPLS Operation\n\n A packet enters an MPLS domain through an ingress edge LSR, where it is processed to\ndetermine which network-layer services it requires, defining its QoS. The LSR assigns this\npacket to a particular FEC, and therefore a particular LSP; appends the appropriate label\nto the packet; and forwards the packet. If no LSP yet exists for this FEC, the edge LSR\nmust cooperate with the other LSRs in defining a new LSP.\n Within the MPLS domain, as each LSR receives a labeled packet, it\na. removes the incoming label and attaches the appropriate outgoing label to the\npacket\nb. forwards the packet to the next LSR along the LSP\n The egress edge LSR strips the label, reads the IP packet header, and forwards the packet\nto its final destination.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fxDSL\nDSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line, and the ‘x’ in xDSL means there are many different\nvarieties of DSL (HDSL, ADSL, etc.). Digital Subscriber Lines are nothing more than high-speed\ndigital communications lines. This is a circuit oriented. Each subscriber has an independent\nconnection. DSL provides dedicated, point to point, public network access. xDSL’s greatest\nadvantages is that it uses the existing telephone lines for the transmission of the data.\nDSL offers several key advantages over other high speed communication solutions :\n\n\n\n\nThe foremost of these is price.\nThe greatest savings come from the fact that DSL runs on existing copper lines.\nMost DSL systems allow voice transmission simultaneously with data traffic.\n\nBy: Er.

          "context": "Physical Layer\n- Physical layer is a layer of OSI network model which is used to connect one sender with\npossibly more receivers.\n- It is the actual transmission medium of bits.\n- It is the only layer that deals with the physical connectivity of two different nodes.\n- It defines hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies and pulses used to represent\nbinary signals.\n- The data link layer provides data frames to physical layer which converts them to electrical\npulses that represent binary data.\nNetwork Monitoring:\nBandwidth:\nIt is defined as the maximum amount of data that can be carried from one point to\nanother in a given time period.\nFor Digital Devices:\n\n\n\nChannel Capacity\nBandwidth is expressed in bits per second (bps)\n\nFor Analog Devices:\n\n\n\nRefers to the range of frequencies in a composite signal or the range of frequencies that\na channel can pass.\nBandwidth is Expressed in cycle per sec OR Hz\n\nThroughput:\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel.\nThroughput is usually measured in bits per second.\nsystem throughput or aggregate throughput\no sum of the data rates that are delivered to all terminals in a network\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fQ. A network with bandwidth of 10 Mbps can pass only an average of 12,000 frames per minute\nwith each frame carrying an average of 10,000 bits. What is the throughput of this network?\nSolution:\nThroughput =\n\n12000 𝑥 10000\n\nBandwidth vs Throughput:\n\n60\n\n= 2 Mbps\n\nBandwidth is the theoretical capability of the connection, the throughput is the actual data rate\nof a specific application.\n\nDelay and loss:\nWhen a package is sent from one host (source) to another host (destination), it travels\nthrough a series of nodes and routers. Travelling from one of these nodes/routers and on to a\nsubsequent node/router, the packet will suffer from different types of delay. The most notable\nand important delays are the processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and\npropagation delay.\nProcessing delay:\nThe time used to examine the packet’s header and determine where to\ndirect it, and check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred in transmission is called the\nprocessing delay. There are also several other factors that affects this delay, for example: The\nneed to check for bit-level errors that has occurred during transmission to the router.\nQueuing Delay:\nThe queuing delay is the time it takes for the packet to be transmitted\nonto the link. Naturally; the length of this time is defined by the number of packets that was\nadded to the queue prior to this packet. It is also very important that the rate of incoming\npackets does not exceed the rate of outgoing packets. If this happens, the delay will approach\ninfinity, and the transmission could suffer packet losses.\nTransmission Delay :\nPackets are commonly transmitted in a first-come-first-serve manner,\nand it is realistic to assume that a packet will not be transmitted until all prior packets are\ntransmitted. The transmission delay is the amount of time used to transmit (push) all of the\npackets bits from the queue and into the link.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fPropagation delay:\nAs the packet does not magically appear straight away on router B after it\nhas been pushed into the link from router A, there is of course a propagation delay. This is the\ntime required to propagate from the beginning of the link and to router B. The speed of the\npropagation heavily depends on the physical medium of the link (fiber optics, twisted pair,\ncopper wire, etc).\nLatency:\nNetwork Latency is the total delay that is introduced by the network.\ni.e. latency = Propagation delay + Transmission delay + Queuing delay + processing delay\n A network which experiences less overall delay is termed to have low latency while opposite\nis termed as high latency.\nJitter:\n• Jitter is the variation in the time between packets arriving, caused by network congestion,\ntiming drift, or route changes.\n• causes of jitter are electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk with other signals.\nPacket Loss:\nPacket loss occurs when one or more packets of data travelling across a computer\nnetwork fail to reach their destination.\nIn our discussions above, we have assumed that the queue is capable of holding an\ninfinite number of packets. In reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity, although the\nqueuing capacity greatly depends on the switch design and cost. Because the queue capacity is\na finite, packet delays do not really approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches one.\nInstead, a packet can arrive to find a full queue. With no place to store such a packet, a router\nwill drop that packet; that is, the packet will be lost. From an end-system viewpoint, this will\nlook like a packet having been transmitted into the network core, but never emerging from the\nnetwork at the destination. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity\nincreases. Therefore, performance at a node is often measured not only in terms of delay, but\nalso in terms of the probability of packet loss.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fTransmission Impairments:\nTransmission impairment is defined as a condition in which the signal’s strength and\nquality gets deteriorated (degraded) as it gets transmission. In any communication system, the\nreceived signal is never identical to the transmitted one due to some transmission impairments.\nThree causes of impairment are attenuation, distortion, and noise.\nCauses of impairment:\n\nAttenuation\nAttenuation means a loss of energy. When a signal, simple or composite, travels through a\nmedium, it loses some of its energy in overcoming the resistance of the medium. That is why a\nwire carrying electric signals gets warm, if not hot, after a while. Some of the electrical energy\nin the signal is converted to heat. To compensate for this loss, amplifiers are used to amplify the\nsignal. Figure 3.26 shows the effect of attenuation and amplification.\n\nAttenuation may be expressed in decibels(dB) as under:\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fWhere,\n\nP2 = power at receiving end\nP1= power at sending end\n\nDistortion:\nDistortion means that the signal changes its form or shape. Distortion can occur in a composite\nsignal made of different frequencies. Each signal component has its own propagation speed\nthrough a medium and, therefore, its own delay in arriving at the final destination. Differences\nin delay may create a difference in phase if the delay is not exactly the same as the period\nduration. In other words, signal components at the receiver have phases different from what\nthey had at the sender. The shape of the composite signal is therefore not the same.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fNoise:\nNoise is another cause of impairment. Several types of noise, such as thermal noise, induced\nnoise, crosstalk, and impulse noise, may corrupt the signal. Thermal noise is the random motion\nof electrons in a wire which creates an extra signal not originally sent by the transmitter.\nInduced noise comes from sources such as motors and appliances. These devices act as a\nsending antenna, and the transmission medium acts as the receiving antenna. Crosstalk is the\neffect of one wire on the other. One wire acts as a sending antenna and the other as the\nreceiving antenna. Impulse noise is a spike (a signal with high energy in a very short time) that\ncomes from power lines, lightning, and so on.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fTransmission Media:\nA communication channel is called a medium. There are two types of media:\n1. Guided Media : twisted pair cable, coaxial cable and fiber optic cable\n2. Unguided Media : radiowave, microwave, infrared and satellite.\nGuided (Wired) Media: Guided Media is a communication medium which allows the data to get\nguided along it i.e. physical connection is need.\nUnguided (Wireless) Media: The wireless media is called unguided media. The signal propagates\nin form of wireless electromagnetic waves.\nGUIDED MEDIA\n1. Twisted Pair Cable\n A twisted pair consists of two conductors (copper), each with its own plastic\ninsulation, twisted together.\n One of the wire is used to carry signals to receiver, and the other is used only as\na ground reference.\n A signal is usually carried as the difference in voltage between the two wires in\nthe pair. This provides better immunity to external noise because the noise tends\nto affect both wire the same, leaving the differential voltage unchanged.\n Frequency range for twisted pair cable is 100Hz to 5MHz.\n RJ 45 or RJ 11 connector is used.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f•\n\nTwo types :\n– Unshielded twisted pair(UTP)\nUTP contains no shielding and is more susceptible to external noise but is the\nmost frequently used because it is inexpensive and easier to install. Eg. Cat5e, Cat6,\nCat6a and Cat7\n– Shielded twisted pair(STP)\nSTP cable contains an outer conductive shield that is electrically grounded to\ninsulate the signals from external electrical noise. STP also uses inner foil shields to\nprotect each wire pair from noise generated by the other pairs. Expensive than\nUTP.eg. IBM STP-A\n\nCharacteristics:\na. Easy to install\nb. Low cost (cheaper than coaxial and optical fiber cable)\nc. High speed capacity i.e. data transfer rate of CAT5e is up to 1 Gbps.\nApplications:\ni. In telephone lines to carry voice and data channels.\nj. To create a local area network.\nk. Ethernet\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f2. Coaxial Cable:\n Coaxial cable carries signals of higher frequency range than those in twisted pair\ncable.\n It has a central core conductor of solid or standard wire (usually copper)\nenclosed in an insulating sheath, which is in turn encased in an outer conductor\nof metal foil.\n The outer metallic wrapping serves both as a shield against noise and as the\nsecond conductor, which completes the circuit. This outer conductor is also\nenclosed in an insulating sheath and the whole cable is protected by a plastic\ncover.\n BNC connector is used.\nCharacteristics:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\n\nDue to shield provided, this cable has excellent noise immunity.\nIt has large bandwidth and low losses.\nExpensive than twisted pair cables but cheaper than fiber optic cable.\nData rate of 10 Mbps and can be increased with increase in diameter of\nthe inner conductor.\n\nCategory of coaxial cable:\nCategory\n\nImpedance\n\nUse\n\nRG-59\n\n75 ohm\n\ncable TV(analog transmission)\n\nRG-58\n\n50 ohm\n\nThin Ethernet(Digital trans.)\n\nRG-11\n\n50 ohm\n\nThick Ethernet(Digital trans.)\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fApplications:\na. Analog and digital telephone network.\nb. Cable TV.\nc. Thick and thin Ethernet. ( Not used these days due to less capacity of the\nchannel.)\nOptical Fiber:\nOptical fiber is a thin, flexible medium capable of guiding an optical ray. Optical fiber\ncable has a cylindrical shape and consists of three sections: core, cladding and jacket.\n\nThe core is a inner layer and is made up of fiber or glass. It is surrounded by a glass cladding\nwhich has a lower refractive index than the core. The outer most layer is of plastic which is\ncalled as jacket.\n\nFig: transfer of light ray inside the core\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fCharacteristics:\na. The light ray inside the fiber does not escape through the walls because of the total\ninternal reflection.\nb. Very high data transfer rate up to 10 Gbps.\nc. It is smaller and light weight but expensive.\nd. It is not affected by noise signals\ne. These cables have much lower attenuation and can carry signal to longer distances\nwithout using amplifiers and repeaters in between.\nf. The installation of fiber optic cables is difficult and tedious.\ng. Joining the optical fibers is a difficult job.\nTypes:\n1. Multimode fiber:\n Larger Core Diameter\n propagate more than one mode of light\n Suited for Short distance Transmission\n Bending losses should be avoided by using large bending radius\n2. Single-mode fiber:\n Only One mode of Light will propagate\n Suited for Long distance transmission\n Bending losses should be avoided by using large bending radius\n\nUnguided Transmission:\nUnguided media transports electromagnetic wave without using a physical conductor.\nThis type of communication is called wireless communication. Signals are normally broadcasted\nthrough air and thus are available to anyone who has a device (antenna) capable to receive\nthem.\nUnguided signals can travel from source to destination in several ways.\n1. Ground propagation\n2. Sky propagation\n3. Line-of-sight propagation\n\n1. Radio Transmission:\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fBasic idea is to transmit signal in the form of radio waves. Radiowaves have\nfrequencies between 3 kHz and 1 GHz. Radiowaves can broadcast\nomnidirectionally or directionally. Various kinds of antennas are used to\nbroadcast these signals.\n Omnidirectional i.e. all directions\n Radiowaves can penetrate through walls.\n Used TV broadcasting and F.M radio broadcasting\nApplications:\na. Cellular communication\nb. Wireless LAN\nc. Satellite communication\n2. Microwave transmission\nThe microwave transmission uses higher frequency range than radio frequency\nas a result, they produce better throughput and performance. Microwave are\nbasically electromagnetic waves having frequency range between 1 GHz and 300\nGHz.\n Microwaves are unidirectional.\n Microwaves propagation is a line of sight propagation.\n Cannot penetrate through walls.\nApplications:\na. In cellular phones\nb. In satellite networks\nc. Wireless LAN\n\n3. Satellite Transmission\nA satellite is simply a repeater. It consists of several transponders each of which\nlistens to some portion of the spectrum, amplifies the incoming signal and the\nrebroadcasts it at another frequency to avoid interference with the incoming\nsignal.\nSatellite communication system consists of ground stations for transmitting and\nreceiving signals and a communication satellite in the space. The range of\nfrequencies used for transmission of signals from ground station to the satellite\nis uplink frequency and those used for transmission of signals from satellites to\nground station is downlink frequency. Uplink and downlink frequencies are\ndifferent to avoid interference.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fTypes of satellite:\n1. LEO (Low Earth Orbit)\nThey are very close to earth ranging from 500 to 1500 km above the\nsurface. They are only visible for 15 to 20 minutes. As they are very close\nto earth surface their coverage area is small but less propagation delay.\n2. MEO (Medium Earth Orbit)\nThey are somewhere between 8000 km to 18000 km above earth surface.\nVisible for around 2 to 8 hours and has larger coverage area than LEO\nsatellite.\n3. GEO(Geostationary Earth Orbit)\nThese satellites are in orbit 35,863 km above the earth’s surface along\nthe equator. They rotate at the speed of earth rotation so they are visible\nall the time. Larger coverage area than LEO and MEO but more\npropagation delay.\nAdvantages:\na. Larger coverage area than a terrestrial system.\nb. Higher bandwidth.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fDisadvantages:\na. Larger propagation delay than terrestrial system.\nb. Launching satellite into orbit is costly.\n\nComparison between guided and unguided media:\nS.N\n\nGuided Media\n\nUnguided Media\n\n1.\n\nThe signal energy propagates through\nwires in guided media.\n\nThe signal energy propagates through air in\nunguided media\n\n2.\n\nGuided media is used for point to point\ncommunication\n\nUnguided media is used for point to point\nand multipoint communication.\n\n3.\n\nSignals are in the form of voltage, current\nor photons in guided media.\n\nSignals are in the form of electromagnetic\nwaves in unguided media.\n\n4.\n\nThere is specific direction for sending a\nsignal.\n\nThere is no particular direction to send\nsignals.\n\n5.\n\ne.g. twisted pair, coaxial cable and optical\nfiber\n\nE.g. radiowaves, microwaves and infrared.\n\nWireless propagation:\nWireless propagation occurs through one of the following three routes:\n1. Ground wave Propagation\nGround Wave propagation is a method of radio wave propagation that uses the\narea between the surface of the earth and the ionosphere for transmission.\nGround wave propagation can be found for the frequency range of few kHz to\n2MHz. There are several factors that help an electromagnetic wave to be\ntransmitted through ground wave propagation. One factor is that the\nelectromagnetic wave induces a current in the Earth’s surface, the result of\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fwhich is to slow the wavefront near the Earth, causing the wavefront to tilt\ndownward and hence follow the Earth’s curvature. Another factor is diffraction,\nwhich is a phenomenon having to do with the behavior of electromagnetic\nwaves in the presence of obstacles. Electromagnetic waves in this frequency\nrange are scattered by the atmosphere in such a way that they do not penetrate\nthe upper atmosphere.\ne.g. AM radio uses ground wave propagation.\n\n2. Sky wave Propagation\nWith sky wave propagation, a signal from an earth-based antenna is reflected from the\nionized layer of the upper atmosphere (ionosphere) back down to Earth. Waves having\nfrequency higher than 2MHz and less than 30 MHz can be propagated through sky wave\npropagation. With this propagation mode, a signal can be picked up thousands of\nkilometers from the transmitter. Eg. Are BBC news\n\n3. Line-of-sight propagation\nAbove 30 MHz, neither ground wave nor sky wave propagation modes operate,\nand communication must be by line of sight. For satellite communication, a\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fsignal above 30 MHz is not reflected by the ionosphere and therefore a signal\ncan be transmitted between an earth station and a satellite. For ground-based\ncommunication, the transmitting and receiving antennas must be within an\neffective line of sight of each other. Eg. satellite communication, FM radio and\nmicrowave.\n\nBaseband and Broadband Network:\nBaseband:\nA Baseband Network is one in which the cable or other network medium can carry only\na single signal at any one time. It is used in digital transmission of signals. i.e. it uses time\ndivision multiplexing (TDM) which uses entire bandwidth of the channel. Typical example of this\nis Ethernet.\nBroadband:\nA Broadband network on the other hand can carry multiple signals simultaneously,\n(using a discrete part of the cable bandwidth for each signal). As analog signals are being\ntransmitted, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) technique is used to transmit multiple\nsignals through single channel. This technique is performed for cable lines using copper wires.\nFor optical fiber broadband services, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is used to\ntransmit different signals through single fiber.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fMultiplexing concept\n Multiplexing is a technique that allows the simultaneous\ntransmission of multiple signal across a single data link.\n Multiplexing is done using a device called multiplexer (MUX) that\ncombines ‘n’ input lines to generate one output line (i.e. many to\none).\n At the receiving end a device called demultiplexer (DEMUX) is used\nthat separates signal into its component signal i.e. one input and\nmany output.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. More than one signal can be send over a single link.\n2. Effective use of bandwidth.\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):\n FDM is an analog technique that combines analog signals\n FDM can be applied when the bandwidth of a link (in hertz) is\ngreater than the combined bandwidth of the signals to be\ntransmitted.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fThe frequency division multiplexing divides the bandwidth of a channel\ninto several logical sub-channels. Each logical sub-channel is allocated for a\ndifferent signal frequency. The individual signals are filtered and then modulated\n(frequency is shifted), in order to fit exactly into logical sub-channels.\nEach logical sub-channel is separated by an unused bandwidth called\nGuard Band to prevent overlapping of signals. In other words, there exists a\nfrequency gap between two adjacent signals to prevent signal overlapping.\nAbove Figure Explanation:\nThe above figure shows the schematic diagram of an FDM system. The\ntransmitter end contains multiple transmitters and the receiver end contains\nmultiple receivers. The communication channel is present between the\ntransmitter and receiver.\nAt transmitter end, each transmitter sends a signal of different frequency. In the\nabove figure, the transmitter 1 sends a signal of 30 kHz, transmitter 2 sends a\nsignal of 40 kHz, and transmitter 3 sends a signal of 50 kHz. These signals of\ndifferent frequencies are then multiplexed or combined by using a device called\nmultiplexer. It then transmits the multiplexed signals over a communication\nchannel.\nAt the receiver end, the multiplexed signals are separated by using a device called\ndemultiplexer. It then sends the separated signals to the respective receivers. In\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fthe above figure, the receiver 1 receives signal of 30 kHz, receiver 2 receives\nsignal of 40 kHz, and receiver 3 receives signal of 50 kHz.\nAdvantages:\n1. A large number of signals can be transmitted simultaneously.\n2. FDM doesn’t need synchronization between sender and receiver.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. The communication channel must have a very large bandwidth.\n2. Large number of modulator and filters are required.\nApplication:\n1. Frequency division multiplexing is used for FM and AM radio\nbroadcasting.\n2. It is used in television broadcasting.\n\nWavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM):\nWavelength division multiplexing is an analog technique. It is the most\nimportant and most popular method to increase the capacity of an optical fiber.\nThe working principle of wavelength division multiplexing is similar to frequency\ndivision multiplexing. The only difference is in wavelength division multiplexing\noptical signals are used instead of electrical signals.\nWavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a technique of multiplexing multiple\noptical carrier signals through a single optical fiber channel by varying the\nwavelengths or colors of laser lights.\nWavelength division multiplexing is a technology that increases the bandwidth of\na communication channel (optical fiber) by simultaneously allowing multiple\noptical signals through it.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fThe combined signal is transmitted via a single optical fiber cable. At the receiving\nend, a demultiplexer splits the incoming beam into its components and each of\nthe beams is send to the corresponding receivers.\n\nThe wavelength division multiplexing divides the bandwidth of a channel into\nseveral logical sub-channels according to its wavelength. It allots each logical subchannel for a different light color or optical signal wavelength. The individual\nsignals are filtered and then modulated (wavelength is shifted), to fit exactly into\nlogical sub-channels.\n\nAdvantages of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)\n1. WDM allows transmission of data in two directions simultaneously (Full\nduplex).\n2. Greater transmission capacity\n3. High security\n4. Long distance communication with low signal loss\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fDisadvantages:\n1. The cost of the system increases with the addition of more optical\ncomponents.\n2. Wavelength tuning is a difficult job.\n\nTime Division Multiplexing (TDM):\nTime Division Multiplexing is digital technique, i.e. it is the process of\ncombining multiple digital signals into one signal.\nTime Division Multiplexing is a technique in which multiple signals are\ncombined and transmitted one after another on the same communication\nchannel.\nAt the receiver side, the signals are separated and received. Each signal is\nreceived by a user at a different time.\nIn frequency division multiplexing, all signals of different frequencies are\ntransmitted simultaneously. But in time division multiplexing, all signals\noperate with the same frequency are transmitted at different times.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fIn time division multiplexing, each user is allotted a particular time interval\ncalled time slot during which data is transmitted. The time interval (time slot)\nallotted to each receiver (user) is so small that the receiver will not detect that\nsome time was used to serve another receiver (user).\nIn time division multiplexing, all signals are not transmitted simultaneously;\ninstead, they are transmitted one after another. For example, as shown in the\nabove figure, at first, we send signal A. Then after second signal B and then\nafter third signal C and finally, we send last signal D. Thus, each user occupies\nan entire bandwidth for a short period of time.\n\nTypes of TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)\nTime Division Multiplexing is mainly classified into two types:\no\no\n\nSynchronous TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)\nAsynchronous TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)\n\nSynchronous TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)\nIn synchronous time division multiplexing, each device (transmitter) is allotted\nwith a fixed time slot, regardless of the fact that the device (transmitter) has\nany data to transmit or not. The device has to transmit data within this time\nslot. If the device (transmitter) does not have any data to send then its time\nslot remains empty.\nThe various time slots are arranged into frames and each frame consists of one\nor more time slots dedicated to each device (transmitter).\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFrom above figure we can see that in time frame 2, the transmitter B and C\ndoes not have any data to send so the time slot B and C remains\nempty.\nThe main drawback of synchronous time division multiplexing is that the\nchannel capacity is not fully utilized. Hence, the bandwidth goes wasted.\n\nAsynchronous/statistical TDM\nAn asynchronous TDM is a technique in which time slots are not fixed as in the\ncase of Synchronous TDM. Time slots are allocated to only those devices which\nhave the data to send. Therefore, we can say that Asynchronous Time Division\nmultiplexor transmits only the data from active workstations.\nThe time slots in asynchronous TDM are always less than the number of devices\n(transmitter). For example, if we have X devices and Y time slots. Y should always\nbe less than X (I.e. Y < X).\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fIn the above figure, it is shown that the number of devices are 4 and time slots\nare 3. The timeframe 1 (all slots) is completely filled with data from devices A, B,\nand C. The timeframe 1 has only 3 time-slots. So the data from device D is filled in\nthe next timeframe (I.e. timeframe 2) in timeslot 1. The data from devices A and D\nwill be filled in timeslots 2 and 3 in timeframe 2.\nIn asynchronous time division multiplexing, the multiplexer scans all the devices\n(transmitters) and accepts input only from the devices that have actual data to\nsend and fills all the frames, and then sends it to the receiver.\nAdvantages of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)\n1. Full bandwidth is utilized by a user at a particular time.\n2. The time division multiplexing technique is more flexible than frequency\ndivision multiplexing.\n3. In time division multiplexing, the problem of crosstalk is very less.\nDisadvantages of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)\n1. Synchronization is required in time division multiplexing.\n2. Complex to implement.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fSwitching:\nSwitching is the process of forwarding message (data packets) from one\nnode to another so that it can reach to the destination. A switched network\nconsists of a series of interlinked nodes, called switches or routers.\nSwitches are devices capable of creating temporary connections between\ntwo or more devices linked to the switch. In a switched network, some of\nthese nodes are connected to the end systems (e.g. computers or\ntelephones). Others are used only for routing.\nCircuit switching:\n In circuit switching network, a communications path between end\ndevices (nodes) needs to be set up before they can communicate.\n There is a need of pre-specified route from which data will travel and\nno other data is permitted.\n It was designed for voice applications. Telephone is the best suitable\nexample of circuit switching.\n\nPhases of Circuit Switch Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircuit Establishment: In this phase, a dedicated circuit is established\nfrom the source to the destination through a number of intermediate\nswitching centers. The sender and receiver transmits communication\nsignals to request and acknowledge establishment of circuits.\nData Transfer: Once the circuit has been established, data and voice are\ntransferred from the source to the destination. The dedicated\nconnection remains as long as the end parties communicate.\nCircuit Disconnection: When data transfer is complete, the connection\nis terminated. The disconnection is initiated by any one of the user.\nDisconnection involves removal of all intermediate links from the sender\nto the receiver.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFig: circuit switched Network.\nAdvantages:\n– It is suitable for long continuous transmission, since a continuous\ntransmission route is established, that remains throughout the\nconversation.\n– The dedicated path ensures a steady data rate of communication.\n– No intermediate delays are found once the circuit is established. So,\nthey are suitable for real time communication of both voice and data\ntransmission.\n\nDisadvantages:\n– Bandwidth requirement is high even in cases of low data volume.\n– There is underutilization of system resources. Once resources are\nallocated to a particular connection, they cannot be used for other\nconnections.\n– Time required in establishing a connection may be high.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fMessage switching:\nMessage switching was a technique developed as an alternate to circuit\nswitching, before packet switching was introduced. In message\nswitching, end users communicate by sending and receiving messages\nthat included the entire data to be shared. Messages are the smallest\nindividual unit.\nAlso, the sender and receiver are not directly connected. There are a\nnumber of intermediate nodes which transfer data and ensure that the\nmessage reaches its destination.\nIn Message Switching technique, there is no establishment of a\ndedicated path between the sender and receiver.\nMessage switching is performed in 2 steps:\nStore and forward – The intermediate nodes have the responsibility of\ntransferring the entire message to the next node. Hence, each node\nmust have storage capacity. A message will only be delivered if the next\nhop and the link connecting it are both available. A store-and-forward\nswitch forwards a message only if sufficient resources are available and\nthe next hop is accepting data.\nMessage delivery – This implies the entire information is transferred in\na single message from source to the destination node. Each message\nmust have a header that contains the message routing information,\nincluding the source and destination.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFig: Message switching network\n\nAdvantages:\n Data channels are shared among the communicating devices that\nimprove the efficiency of using available bandwidth.\n Traffic congestion can be reduced because the message is\ntemporarily stored in the nodes.\n Message priority can be used to manage the network.\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n\nThe message switches must be equipped with sufficient storage to\nenable them to store the messages until the message is forwarded.\nThe Long delay can occur due to the storing and forwarding facility\nprovided by the message switching technique.\n\nPacket Switching\n\n\n\n\n\nThe packet switching is a switching technique in which the message is sent\nin one go, but it is divided into smaller pieces, and they are sent\nindividually.\nThe message splits into smaller pieces known as packets and packets are\ngiven a unique number to identify their order at the receiving end.\nEvery packet contains some information in its headers such as source\naddress, destination address and sequence number.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f\n\n\n\n\nPackets will travel across the network, taking the shortest path as possible.\nAll the packets are reassembled at the receiving end in correct order.\nIf any packet is missing or corrupted, then the message will be sent to\nresend the message.\nIf the correct order of the packets is reached, then the acknowledgment\nmessage will be sent.\n\nAdvantages Of Packet Switching:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost-effective: In packet switching technique, switching devices do not\nrequire massive secondary storage to store the packets, so cost is\nminimized to some extent. Therefore, we can say that the packet switching\ntechnique is a cost-effective technique.\nReliable: If any node is busy, then the packets can be rerouted. This\nensures that the Packet Switching technique provides reliable\ncommunication.\nEfficient: Packet Switching is an efficient technique. It does not require any\nestablished path prior to the transmission, and many users can use the\nsame communication channel simultaneously, hence makes use of available\nbandwidth very efficiently\n\nDisadvantages Of Packet Switching:\n\n\n\nPacket Switching technique cannot be implemented in those applications\nthat require low delay and high-quality services.\nThe protocols used in a packet switching technique are very complex and\nrequires high implementation cost.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f1) Datagram Packet Switching (Connectionless packet switching)\n• It is a packet switching technology in which packet is known as a\ndatagram, is considered as an independent entity. Each packet\ncontains the information about the destination and switch(router)\nuses this information to forward the packet to the correct\ndestination.\n• The packets are reassembled at the receiving end in correct order.\n• In Datagram Packet Switching technique, the path is not fixed.\n• Intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward the\npackets.\n2) Virtual Circuit Switching (Connection oriented packet switching)\n– In the case of Virtual circuit switching, a preplanned route is\nestablished before the messages are sent.\n– the data stream is transferred over a packet switched network, in\nsuch a way that it seems to the user that there is a dedicated path\nfrom the sender to the receiver.\n– Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the\nconnection between sender and receiver.\n– In this case, the path is fixed for the duration of a logical connection.\nLets understand through a diagram below:\n– In the above diagram, A and B are the sender and receiver respectively. 1\nand 2 are the nodes.\n– Call request and call accept packets are used to establish a connection\nbetween the sender and receiver.\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\f– When a route is established, data will be transferred.\n– After transmission of data, an acknowledgment signal is sent by the\nreceiver that the message has been received.\n– If the user wants to terminate the connection, a clear signal is sent for the\ntermination.\n\nISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network):\n It is the name for digital telephone service that works over existing copper\ntelephone wiring. Thus ISDN is a high speed, fully digital telephone service.\n ISDN was developed by ITU-T(International Telecommunication Union,\nTelecommunication Standardization Sector) in 1976. It is a set of protocols\nthat combines digital telephony and data transport services.\n ISDN involves digitization of the telephone network, which permits voice,\ndata, text, graphics, music, video and other resources to be transmitted\nover existing telephone wires.\n\nISDN basically provides three types of services:\n1. Bearer services\n2. Teleservices\n3. Supplementary services\n\nBy: Er. Saurav Raj Pant, IOE - TU\n\n\fFig: ISDN services\nBearer services:\nBearer services provide the means to transfer information (voice, data and video)\nbetween users without the network manipulating the content of that\ninformation. The network does not need to process the information and therefore\ndoes not change the content.\nBearer services belong to the first three layers of the OSI model and are well\ndefined in the ISDN standard. They can be provided using circuit-switched,\npacket-switched, frame-switched, or cell-switched networks.\nTeleservices:\nIn teleservices, the network may change or process the contents of the data.\nThese services correspond to layers 4-7 of the OSI model. Teleservices relay on\nthe facilities of the bearer services and are designed to accommodate complex\nuser needs, without the user having to be aware of the details of the process.\nTeleservices include telephony, teletex, telefax, videotex, telex and\nteleconferencing. Although the ISDN defines these services by name, they have\nnot yet become standards.\nSupplementary Service: Supplementary services are those services that provide\nadditional functionality to the bearer services and teleservices. Examples of these\nservices are reverse charging, call waiting, and message handling, all familiar from\ntoday’s telephone company services.\n\nBy: Er.

Intelligence in the network.\n5. Layered protocol architecture.\n6. Variety of configuration.\nISDN devices: ISDN devices can be classified into three types:\n1. Terminal equipment, TE1 and TE2\n2. Terminal Adapters, TA\n3.
